Here's an in-depth breakdown of the MySQL commands you mentioned, with more explanation to help you understand the concepts fully:

### 1. **Basic SELECT Queries**

This is the most fundamental query to retrieve data from a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
- `*` selects all columns.
- You can replace `*` with specific columns: 
  ```sql
  SELECT name, salary FROM Employees;
  ```

### 2. **Filtering with WHERE**

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records that meet certain conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```
- You can also use other conditions like:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE salary > 50000;
  ```

### 3. **Sorting Results with ORDER BY**

You use `ORDER BY` to sort the result set by one or more columns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
- `ASC` (ascending) is the default, while `DESC` (descending) shows the highest value first.

### 4. **JOINs**

**INNER JOIN**: Returns only rows where there is a match in both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**FULL JOIN**: Not directly available in MySQL, but you can simulate it by combining `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` with `UNION`.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
UNION
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

### 5. **GROUP BY**

This groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, often used with aggregate functions.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### 6. **HAVING**

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter records after theyâ€™ve been grouped.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING total_employees > 10;
```

### 7. **Aggregate Functions**

- **COUNT**: Counts the number of rows.

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
  ```

- **SUM**: Adds up the values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 1;
  ```

- **AVG**: Finds the average value.

  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 1;
  ```

- **MIN/MAX**: Finds the minimum/maximum values in a column.

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 1;
  ```

### 8. **Subqueries**

A subquery is a query inside another query, which can be useful for filtering based on calculated data.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees);
```

### 9. **Creating Tables**

Defines the structure of a new table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### 10. **Inserting Data**

Used to add new records into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, name, department_id, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 2, 60000);
```

### 11. **Updating Data**

You update existing records using `UPDATE`.

```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET salary = 65000
WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

### 12. **Deleting Data**

Removes records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE employee_id = 1;
```

### 13. **Indexes**

Indexes speed up the retrieval of records by creating a fast lookup for columns.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON Employees(department_id);
```

### 14. **Foreign Keys**

Foreign keys enforce relationships between tables.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id);
```

### 15. **Transactions**

Transactions allow you to execute multiple queries as a single unit of work, ensuring data integrity.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 1;
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE employee_id = 3;

COMMIT;
```

- If something goes wrong, you can roll back the changes:
  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

### 16. **UNION**

Combines results from multiple `SELECT` queries. Each `SELECT` must have the same number of columns.

```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE department_id = 1
UNION
SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE salary > 70000;
```

### 17. **Triggers**

A trigger is a set of SQL statements that automatically "fires" when a specified event occurs.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER salary_before_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.salary = NEW.salary + 5000;
```

### 18. **Views**

A view is like a virtual table based on a result set of a query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_earning_employees AS
SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary > 70000;
```

### **Example of a Complex Query**

This query combines multiple concepts: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`.

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees, AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
HAVING average_salary > 50000
ORDER BY total_employees DESC;
```

This helps you:

- **JOIN** two tables (`Employees` and `Departments`).
- **GROUP BY** department names.
- **HAVING** filters departments with an average salary greater than 50,000.
- **ORDER BY** sorts departments by the number of employees in descending order.
