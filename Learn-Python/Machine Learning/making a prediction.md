### What does "making a prediction" mean?

When we **train a model** (like `linear_model.fit(X_train, y_train)`), we teach the model to **learn patterns** in the data from the **training set** (which consists of `X_train` features and `y_train` labels).

After training, we want the model to make predictions on **new, unseen data** (which is in the test set). We use the trained model to **predict values for the test set** features (`X_test`). These predictions are compared to the actual labels (`y_test`) to see how well the model performs.

In simple terms:
- **X** refers to the input features (what we use to make predictions).
- **y** refers to the actual target values (what we want to predict).
- **Making a prediction** means using the trained model to predict the **y values** (targets) for the **X values** (features) in the test set.

### In the code:
```python
y_pred = linear_model.predict(X_test)
```

- **`X_test`** is a set of features (input data) that the model has never seen during training. 
- **`predict(X_test)`** means the model will take these test data features (`X_test`) and use what it learned during training to **predict** what the target values (`y_pred`) might be.
- **`y_pred`** is the predicted output for the test set features.

### Example for Clarity

Imagine you're trying to predict **house prices** based on features like **size** and **number of rooms**. Here's how the process works:

- During training, the model learns how **size** and **number of rooms** relate to **house price**.
- After training, the model is given **new data** (unseen data), e.g., a house with **size = 1200 sqft** and **rooms = 3**. 
- The model then **predicts** the price for that house using what it learned from the training data.

In the code:
```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
- The model is making predictions on **new houses** (represented by `X_test`), and predicting their **prices** (represented by `y_pred`).
