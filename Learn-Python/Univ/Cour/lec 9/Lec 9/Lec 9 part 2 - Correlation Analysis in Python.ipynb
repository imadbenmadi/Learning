    "#### **What is Correlation Analysis?**\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis** is a statistical method to evaluate the **strength and direction** of the relationship between two quantitative variables.\n",
    "- Measures **how changes in one variable are associated** with changes in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concept: Correlation Coefficient (\"r\")**\n",
    "- **Range:** -1 to +1\n",
    "  - **Positive Correlation** (r → +1): Both variables increase together.\n",
    "  - **Negative Correlation** (r → -1): One variable increases, the other decreases.\n",
    "  - **No Correlation** (r ≈ 0): Weak or no linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**\n",
    "- Most common method for **linear relationships**.\n",
    "- Best for **continuous data** without significant outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Other Correlation Coefficients**\n",
    "- **Spearman’s Rank Correlation:** For ordinal data or non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- **Kendall’s Tau:** Used for smaller datasets or to handle ties in rankings.\n",
    "- **Point-Biserial Correlation:** For one continuous and one binary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications Across Fields**\n",
    "- Used in **economics**, **social sciences**, **finance**, and more.\n",
    "- **Helps identify relationships** but does not imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Important Reminder**\n",
    "- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: A correlation does not mean one variable causes changes in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion**\n",
    "- Correlation analysis is a powerful tool for **understanding relationships** but should be interpreted carefully.\n",

    "  - Some association; as one variable changes, the other has a moderate tendency to follow.\n",
    "- **0.60 - 0.79**: **Strong Correlation**  \n",
    "  - Strong association; as one variable changes, the other tends to follow significantly.\n",
