    "### What does this class cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-Learn library is very capable. However, learning everything off by heart isn't necessary. \n",
    "Instead, this notebook focuses some of the main use cases of the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where can I get help?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through a range of common and useful featues of the Scikit-Learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's long but it's called quick because of how vast the Scikit-Learn library is. Covering everything requires a [full-blown documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), of which, if you ever get stuck, you should read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck or think of something you'd like to do which this notebook doesn't cover, don't fear!\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended steps you take are:\n",
    "1. **Try it** - Since Scikit-Learn has been designed with usability in mind, your first step should be to use what you know and try figure out the answer to your own question (getting it wrong is part of the process). If in doubt, run your code.\n",
    "2. **Press SHIFT+TAB** - See you can the docstring of a function (information on what the function does) by pressing **SHIFT + TAB** inside it. Doing this is a good habit to develop. It'll improve your research skills and give you a better understanding of the library. \n",
    "3. **Search for it** - If trying it on your own doesn't work, since someone else has probably tried to do something similar, try searching for your problem. You'll likely end up in 1 of 2 places:\n",
    "    * [Scikit-Learn documentation/user guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - the most extensive resource you'll find for Scikit-Learn information.\n",
    "    * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is the developers Q&A hub, it's full of questions and answers of different problems across a wide range of software development topics and chances are, there's one related to your problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example of searching for a Scikit-Learn solution might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"how to tune the hyperparameters of a sklearn model\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching this on Google leads to the Scikit-Learn documentation for the `GridSearchCV` function: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The next steps here are to read through the documentation, check the examples and see if they line up to the problem you're trying to solve. If they do, **rewrite the code** to suit your needs, run it, and see what the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ask for help** - If you've been through the above 3 steps and you're still stuck, you might want to ask your question on [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com). Be as specific as possible and provide details on what you've tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't have to learn all of the functions off by heart to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's most important is continually asking yourself, **\"what am I trying to do with the data?\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by answering that question and then practicing finding the code which does it.\n"

For instance, in a linear regression model, each feature has a corresponding weight that determines its contribution to the output prediction. In neural networks, weights represent the strengths of connections between neurons in different layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biases:** Biases are additional parameters in a model that allow shifting the output, providing more flexibility and expressiveness. In a neural network, biases are added to the weighted sum of inputs and act similarly to intercepts in linear models. They allow the model to represent patterns even when all input features are zeros.\n",

    "-  b is the bias term.\n",

This process involves optimization algorithms like gradient descent, where the model learns the best values for weights and biases to make accurate predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, these parameters become more complex, as there are multiple layers with interconnected neurons, each having its set of weights and biases. Adjusting these parameters through techniques like backpropagation with gradient descent is crucial for training neural networks effectively.\n",
